You have code, and you need an easy way to document it. You might even want the docs to live in the github pages branch of the code's repository. If you are using Python, we recommend [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/contents.html) documentation built automatically on [readthedocs](http://readthedocs.org/), but this may be too complicated, or not suitable for your needs. This is RedDocs, with substantial thanks to  <a href="https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material" target="_blank">mkdocs material,</a>. We have added a front page and jekyll-ized that theme, adding automatic generation of pages and navigation for docs. 

Here we'll show you what RedDocs looks like and how you will use it. Take a look to the left. There is a sidebar with links, and contents (what you are reading now). When you click the link it scrolls to the section, and that's it.

Let's get started!
